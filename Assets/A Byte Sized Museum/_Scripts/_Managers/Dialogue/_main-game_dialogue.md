# First Chamber Breaking Dialogue
## Triggers immediately upon loading the scene

We have an emergency!

The Museum's Chrono Chamber has collapsed!

Someone must have been messing around with the <color=red>Time Fragments</color> again.

We still have the situation under control.

All we have to do is retrieve these <color=red>Time Fragments</color> back so we can repair the Chamber.

The Exhibit you are in right now is the Museum's <color=green>Central Exhibit</color>, where the Chrono Chamber is Located.

The Chrono Chamber is that massive device you see in the middle of the room.

At the top-right of your screen, you can see a map, a timer, and a counter for the <color=red>Time Fragments</color> you've collected.

The timer tracks how much time you have left until the Chamber completely collapses.

<color=red>Time Fragments</color> can be retrieved from puzzles scattered around this museum.

Exhibits highlighted in <color=red>Red</color> are <color=red>Puzzle Exhibits</color>

You need to locate these and solve the puzzles located in them to retrieve a Time Fragment.

Use these <color=red>Time Fragments</color> to repair the Chrono Chamber.

You must fully repair the Chrono Chamber before the Chamber completely collapses.

We deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause during your visit.

We wish you the best of luck in your mission to save A Byte-Sized Museum.

The fate of our museum is in your hands.

If you need any assistance, simply press the <color=yellow>P</color> key.
